# Summary
Bitcoin Wallet Web App for requesting ull, spent, and unspent balances related to specified Bitcoin (BTC) Wallets.

This directory contains all the view/client-side code the web app.

The user interface (UI) allows for toggling between two views -- one for requesting full BTC Wallet balances and another for requesting either spent or unspent BTC Wallet balances.

For the sake of brevity, I created it with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA).

## Available Scripts

These are all pretty standard scripts for apps bootstrapped with CRA.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
